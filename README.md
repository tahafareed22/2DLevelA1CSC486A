# 2DLevelA1CSC486A
2D level design for csc 486A

My project is a mario kind of platformer in a fantasy world.

I successfully completed everything on the required list.

(4) I got three tilesheets and edited the grid sizes to fix the items I got every single tilesheet from Unity Asset Store

(5) I used a background sky tilesheet, trees, and platforms for the character to jump on

(6) I put every single Tile sheet into an atlas for you to see
